    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/Murphy_Cooper">Murphy Cooper</a>
        is the charater in movie
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)">Interstellar</a>. 
        Murphy's mother passed away a long time ago, and her most dependent father
        went on a voyage to save humanity when she was very young. But instead of
        wasting her life missing her father, she followed Dr.Brand as a physicist and
        helped him to solve the gravity problem that has plagued him all his life. In
        the end, with the efforts of Murphy and her father, humanity has successfully
        arrived at the space station and is going to sail to a new habitable planet.
